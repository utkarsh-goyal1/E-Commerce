// the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.


// How Login is done using passport-------------------------
// User Authentication Flow:

// Login: When a user successfully logs in, passport.authenticate() calls req.login(), which in turn calls serializeUser() to store user 
// information in the session.
// Note - If we loged in the user and we are not authenticating user on each request or not maintaining the user loged in state 
//        then it might happen that user shares the url with another person and that person will also use our website.
//        So we should authenticate the user on each request but it is not a good way to login the user on each request. 
//        So we use "'passport.session()'" middleware. This helps in remembering the user.
//        So when a user is loged in then passport calls serializeUser() to store user's information in the session.
// Subsequent Requests: On each new request, passport.session() checks if a user ID is stored in the session. If so, it calls 
// deserializeUser() to retrieve the full user object and attaches it to req.user.After that isAuthenticated() method (used in isloggedin
// middleware) checks if the user is present in the request object. if yes then give access to the user.
// Logout: When a user logs out using req.logout(), Passport removes the user data from the session.
